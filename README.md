# Project-for-Code-Louisville
My project is a website for my mother. She is an artist and needs a place to display and sell her art. My intention was to create the home page for now and continue to add on and develop additional pages with information on her paitings later. I have two media queries for a display of 1024px and a display of 640px.  I have included a navigation menu that expands and collapses when clicking the hamburger icon that scrolls to either her contact or more about her the smooth scroll is used in Javascript. I have also created the navbar to disappear and reappear depending on the websites pixels. I have used CSS Flexbox to show columns and rows by wrapping the text and the borders. I created a contact form with name, email, address and information box for someone to put information about what type of art piece they would like to purchase using Javascript. I hope you enjoy navigating my very first website!
